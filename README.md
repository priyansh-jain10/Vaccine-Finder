# Vaccine-Finder
Finding out vaccine availibility using setu cowin api
This App was built in Android studio using Java.
This library used for API calls was Volley.
I Filtered the vaccines according to age categories and stored them in different Fragments. 
I also used Model classes to store and retrieve data.
Later i used View Pager to switch between Fragments. 
I Tried to keep minimum user iterface and make card color change according to vaccine availibility.

You can download this app using the APK file
